This data set conteint a total of 194,673 collision incidents with 37 attributes . It was decided not to use for two reasons, firstly there have a lot of missing columns (seriousinjuries, fatalities and injuries), the missing columns are very important in determining the severity. And the second razon, is severycode column only have two values out of a total of five possible values according to metadata.\n\n####  Kaggle have a better version of this data set provided also by the Seattle Department of Transportation. There have a total of 221,144 collision incidents with 40 attributes. In this case, data ser includes the important columns seriousinjuries, fatalities, and injuries and the severitycode column has all 5 possible values.\n\n#### Of the 40 possible columns, for the generation of the model in the first place target is the SEVERITYCODE field and the following columns are preliminarily chosen as feactures: seriousinjuries, fatalities, injuries, wheather, collisiontype, vehcount, roadcond, intkey, roadcond, speeding, pedcount , addrtype, lightcond, personcount, junctiontype, underinfl, inattentinind.\n"
