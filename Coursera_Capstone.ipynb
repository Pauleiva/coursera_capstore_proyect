The World Health Organization (WHO) qualifies the situation of traffic accidents as a priority public health problem throughout the world.Citizens in general are not aware of the magnitude of the problem of traffic accidents in the world, nor is it possible to quantify the number of people who, as a result of a traffic accident, are disabled for life and yet appear in the figures only as injured.In addition to the loss of human life, traffic accidents produce a huge economic impact, which, directly or indirectly, all citizens bear. It is estimated that on average the costs of traffic accidents reach 3% of the GDP of a country according to WHO figures, if this money were invested in education, housing, health, social assistance, imagine the benefit it would represent for our society.hese are the leading cause of death in young people.\n\n* Problem\n\nIn this proyect will build a model to predict the severity of an acciden.The problem that this model seeks to solve is the ignorance that drivers have about the probabilities of an accident on a certain route and its severity, due to different variables such as the weather and road conditions, among others, that makes it impossible for drivers to make decisions in advance, such as driving more carefully or changing routes.\n* Interest\n\nNot only drivers are interested in knowing the probabilities of a traffic accident to choose a better route, be careful when driving or postpone their trip. But it is also considered a global health problem, so it is in the interest of those responsible for transport in each country, to better understand the contributing factors and the relationships between them in order to introduce specific awareness campaigns and programs to reduce costs. road safety incidents, seeking as a major goal to reduce in this way the people affected by their health and the GDP expenditure of each country in traffic accidents."
